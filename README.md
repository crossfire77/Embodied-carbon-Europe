# Documentation
## Usage Notes
The scripts provided in this repository have been established as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which contain annotations and comments for improved understanding. Documentation on the dataset, how it was built as well as some analyses and visualiation can be found in the related reports
* Towards embodied carbon benchmarks for buildings in Europe - #1 Facing the data challenge (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6120522)
* Towards embodied carbon benchmarks for buildings in Europe - #2 Setting the baseline. A bottom-up approach" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5895051)

## Data
Folder <code>/00_data/</code> contains the embodied carbon data (.xls/.csv) in multiple versions. The folder includes raw data from the original sources in the respective formats; the preprocessed and cleaned data; a harmonized version of the dataset including data from all sources, following a consistent data structure acc. to the pre-established EU-ECB data collection form (developed based on [Röck et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114107)); as well as a version including additional features engineered in the respective scripts.
* <code>.../0_data_input_raw/</code> - Original data in the respective formats. Including  data collected via the EU-ECB data collection form.
* <code>.../1_data_pre_processed/</code> - Data preprocessed based on the original formats
* <code>.../2_data_concatenated/</code> - Data from all sources, concatenated in a harmonized format based on the data collection template form. 
* <code>.../3_data_feature_engineered/</code> - Concatenated data in harmonized format with additional engineered features.

## Running
To rerun the whole preprocessing and visualization pipeline run [00_Main.ipynb] script. Open and run individual notebooks from the root directory to only run selected parts of the procedure.
* <code>00_Main.ipynb</code> - Script for running the full preprocessing, feature engineering and visualization pipeline, i.e. calling all other scripts in consectutive order.
* <code>01_Prepoc*.ipynb</code> - Scripts for preprocessing of the respective data based on their original formats.
* <code>02_Data_Concat.ipynb</code> - Script for concatenating the original data in a common format.
* <code>03_Data_FeatEng.ipynb</code> - Script for engineering additional features based on the harmonized, concatenated data.
* <code>04_DataAnalysis*.ipynb</code> - Script for analysis and visualization of the data.

## Figures
Folder <code>/01_figures/</code> contains various visual outputs of the analysis including boxplots and heatmaps. The contents of this folder can be updated and are overwritten(!) when running <code>04_DataAnalysis*.ipynb</code> script.


# Background
## Embodied Carbon in the Building Sector
Funded by the [Laudes Foundation](https://www.laudesfoundation.org/), the project '['Towards embodied carbon benchmarks for buildings in Europe' project](https://c.ramboll.com/lets-reduce-embodied-carbon), by [Ramboll](https://ramboll.com/) in collaboration with leading researchers from [Aalborg University Build](https://www.build.aau.dk/) and [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/research/), set out a framework for benchmarking and limiting the embodied carbon of new buildings.

The study identified solutions to measure embodied carbon emissions, define carbon budgets and targets. Importantly it includes recommendations for a baseline of current embodied carbon levels in new buildings, as well as considerations of the available carbon budget for these emissions. This will form the basis of a performance system in the shape of benchmarks for the reduction of embodied carbon.
